1. I have learned how to create an HTML page structure with tags and attributes. Specifically: how to include images with caption, the difference between absolute and relative path, when and how to use captions, horizontal rule, <del> tag, <sup> tag, insert line breaks, semantic difference between <bold> and <strong>tags.

2. The easy part was understanding how HTML works.

3. A difficult but useful part was learning to research for solution to a problem by using the right keywords.

4. I researched what I wanted to do in HTML and, consequentely, found the tags I needed.
